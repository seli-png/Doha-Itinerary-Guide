    <h2>General Overview of Qatar</h2>
    <h3>Location: </h3>
    <p>
        Qatar is a peninsula in the Arabian Gulf, strategically located near key international shipping routes. It shares its only land border with Saudi Arabia to the south and is surrounded by the Arabian Gulf on three sides. Its central location makes it a convenient gateway between Europe, Asia, and Africa.
    </p>

    <h3>Climate: </h3>
    <p>
        Qatar experiences a desert climate characterized by hot summers (May-September) where temperatures can soar above 45°C (113°F), and mild, pleasant winters (October-April) with temperatures averaging 20°C (68°F). Rainfall is sparse, with occasional showers during the cooler months.
    </p>

    <h3>Language: </h3>

            <p>       &nbsp; 3. Basic medications.</p>
            <p>• For additional coverage, residents can purchase private health insurance plans, which may include:</p>
